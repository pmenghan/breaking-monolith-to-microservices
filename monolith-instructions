# Monolithic Application Migration to Cloud

## Application Components

- **Catalogue**: Product details (name, price, etc.)
- **User**: User registration and login workflows
- **Cart**: Products added to cart by users
- **Orders**: Order details placed by users
- **Payment**: Payment details for orders

## Migration Strategy

The goal is to convert the monolith into independent microservices. Components will be extracted in the following order to maintain application integrity:

1. Payment
2. Orders
3. Cart
4. User
5. Catalogue

This order is chosen due to MySQL table dependencies and joins in the monolithic system.

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: EC2 Instance Setup

1. Provision EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI
2. Open ports 22, 3306, 5000 from any source (0.0.0.0/0)
3. Name instance "monolith"
4. SSH into instance

### Step 2: MySQL Installation

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y mariadb-server
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

MySQL secure installation options:
- Initial password: [blank]
- Set root password: Y
- Remove anonymous users: Y
- Disallow root login remotely: n
- Remove test database: n
- Reload privilege tables: Y

Configure MySQL:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
# Add in line 2:
bind-address=0.0.0.0

mysql -uroot -p
# Enter password when prompted
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
```

### Step 3: Database Setup

1. Connect to server using MySQL Workbench
2. Copy and run script from:
   ```
   https://github.com/pravinmenghani1/breaking-monolith-to-microservices/blob/main/db.sql
   ```

### Step 4: Application Deployment

```bash
yum install git -y
git clone <code-shared-by-pravin>
cd monolith

# Update config.py with password

yum install python3
yum install mysql-devel gcc gcc-devel python3-devel
easy_install mysql-python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```

Access application at:
```
http://<Public IP of EC2>:5000/
```

The application now supports:
- User registration
- Login
- Add to Cart
- Place Order functionality
